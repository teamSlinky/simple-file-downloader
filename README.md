# Simple File Download Page

## Summary

I built this as a bit of a stop gap solution for a client. The idea was that the client provided a custom URL to their users, the user clicks on the URL and clinks the downlaod link to download the file. 


## How it works

This page is a simple PHP page which takes the files reference from the URL (via $_GET) and pushes it out to the page with a link to download.
